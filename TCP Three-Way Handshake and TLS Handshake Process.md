## 1. TCP Three-Way Handshake

The **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) Three-Way Handshake** is a critical mechanism used to establish a reliable connection between a client and a server. It ensures both parties are synchronized, ready to communicate, and can track data order effectively.

### Process Steps

1. **SYN (Synchronize) Packet**
    - **Action**: The client initiates the connection by sending a TCP packet with the **SYN flag** set.
    - **Details**:
        - Contains an **Initial Sequence Number (ISN)**, a random number chosen by the client to track the order of data it sends.
    - **Purpose**: Requests the server to open a connection.
2. **SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge) Packet**
    - **Action**: The server responds to the client’s SYN packet with a TCP packet that has both **SYN** and **ACK flags** set.
    - **Details**:
        - The **ACK flag** acknowledges the client’s ISN by setting the acknowledgment number to **client’s ISN + 1**.
        - The **SYN flag** indicates the server’s agreement to establish a connection and includes its own **ISN** for tracking its data.
    - **Purpose**: Confirms receipt of the client’s request and proposes the server’s sequence number.
3. **ACK (Acknowledge) Packet**
    - **Action**: The client responds with a TCP packet with the **ACK flag** set.
    - **Details**:
        - The acknowledgment number is set to the **server’s ISN + 1**, confirming receipt of the server’s SYN-ACK.
    - **Purpose**: Finalizes the connection setup, allowing both parties to begin data transmission.

### Why Is the TCP Three-Way Handshake Important?

- **Reliability**: Ensures both client and server are ready to communicate, synchronize sequence numbers, and agree on connection parameters.
- **Connection Establishment**: Guarantees both parties are prepared, preventing data loss or misordering.
- **Duplicate Data Prevention**: Sequence and acknowledgment numbers help manage data order and detect duplicates.

### Summary Table: TCP Three-Way Handshake

| **Step** | **Description** | **Flags** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. SYN | Client sends SYN packet with Initial Sequence Number (ISN). | SYN | Initiates connection request. |
| 2. SYN-ACK | Server responds with SYN and ACK, acknowledging client’s ISN and sending its ISN. | SYN, ACK | Confirms receipt and agrees to connect. |
| 3. ACK | Client acknowledges server’s ISN with ACK packet. | ACK | Finalizes connection establishment. |

## 2. TLS Handshake Process

The **TLS (Transport Layer Security) Handshake** is a process that establishes a secure, encrypted connection between a client and a server. It ensures mutual authentication, agreement on cryptographic protocols, and generation of session keys for secure data exchange.

### Process Steps

1. **Client Hello**
    - **Action**: The client sends a **Client Hello** message to the server.
    - **Details**:
        - Includes the supported **TLS version**, a list of supported **cipher suites** (cryptographic algorithms), and a random value called the **Client Random**.
    - **Purpose**: Initiates the TLS handshake and shares client capabilities.
2. **Server Hello**
    - **Action**: The server responds with a **Server Hello** message.
    - **Details**:
        - Selects a **TLS version** and **cipher suite** from the client’s list.
        - Sends a random value called the **Server Random**.
        - Sends its **digital certificate**, which contains the server’s **public key** and identity information for authentication.
    - **Purpose**: Confirms the server’s choices and provides authentication material.
3. **Server Authentication and Certificate Verification**
    - **Action**: The client verifies the server’s digital certificate.
    - **Details**:
        - The client checks the certificate against trusted **Certificate Authorities (CAs)** to ensure the server’s authenticity.
        - If required, the server may request the client’s certificate for mutual authentication.
    - **Purpose**: Ensures the server is legitimate and trusted.
4. **Client Key Exchange (Pre-Master Secret)**
    - **Action**: The client generates and sends a **pre-master secret**.
    - **Details**:
        - The pre-master secret is a random number encrypted with the server’s **public key** (obtained from the certificate).
    - **Purpose**: Shares a secret value used to derive session keys.
5. **Server Decrypts Pre-Master Secret**
    - **Action**: The server decrypts the pre-master secret.
    - **Details**:
        - Uses its **private key** to decrypt the pre-master secret.
        - Both client and server now share the pre-master secret.
    - **Purpose**: Ensures both parties have the same secret for key generation.
6. **Session Keys Generation**
    - **Action**: Both parties generate symmetric **session keys**.
    - **Details**:
        - Using the **Client Random**, **Server Random**, and **pre-master secret**, both compute the same **master secret**.
        - Symmetric **session keys** are derived from the master secret for encryption and decryption.
    - **Purpose**: Creates keys for secure data exchange.
7. **Client Change Cipher Spec and Finished**
    - **Action**: The client sends a **Change Cipher Spec** message and a **Finished** message.
    - **Details**:
        - The **Change Cipher Spec** indicates that subsequent messages will be encrypted with the session key.
        - The **Finished** message is encrypted and verifies the handshake’s integrity.
    - **Purpose**: Signals readiness to use encryption and confirms handshake completion.
8. **Server Change Cipher Spec and Finished**
    - **Action**: The server sends its own **Change Cipher Spec** and **Finished** messages.
    - **Details**:
        - The server signals that it will use the session key for encryption.
        - The encrypted **Finished** message confirms the handshake’s integrity.
    - **Purpose**: Finalizes the handshake from the server’s side.
9. **Secure Encrypted Communication Begins**
    - **Action**: Both parties begin exchanging data.
    - **Details**:
        - Data is encrypted using the symmetric **session keys** for confidentiality and integrity.
    - **Purpose**: Enables secure communication over the established connection.

### Summary Table: TLS Handshake Process

| **Step** | **Description** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Client Hello | Client sends TLS version, cipher suites, and Client Random. | Initiates handshake and shares client capabilities. |
| 2. Server Hello | Server selects TLS version, cipher suite, sends Server Random and certificate. | Confirms choices and provides authentication material. |

| 4. Client Key Exchange | Client sends encrypted pre-master secret. | Shares secret for key generation. |
| 5. Server Decrypts Secret | Server decrypts pre-master secret using its private key. | Ensures both parties share the pre-master secret. |
| 6. Session Key Creation | Both generate master secret and symmetric session keys. | Creates keys for secure communication. |
| 7. Client Change Cipher Spec & Finished | Client signals encryption readiness and sends encrypted Finished message. | Confirms handshake integrity and readiness for encryption. |
| 8. Server Change Cipher Spec & Finished | Server signals encryption readiness and sends encrypted Finished message. | Finalizes handshake and confirms encryption readiness. |
| 9. Encrypted Communication | Secure data exchange begins using session keys. | Enables confidential and integrity-protected communication. |

### Key Notes

- **TCP vs. TLS Handshake**:
    - The **TCP Three-Way Handshake** establishes a reliable connection at the transport layer, ensuring data order and reliability.
    - The **TLS Handshake** operates at the application layer (on top of TCP) to provide security through encryption and authentication.
- **Interdependence**: The TLS handshake requires a TCP connection to be established first via the three-way handshake.
- **Security**: TLS ensures confidentiality (encryption), integrity (data not altered), and authentication (verifying identities).
- **Reliability**: TCP ensures no data is lost or misordered during transmission, complementing TLS’s security features.
