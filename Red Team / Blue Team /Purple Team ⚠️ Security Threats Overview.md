## **Red Team / Blue Team / Purple Team**

### **🔴 Red Team (Offensive Security)**

**Role:** Simulates real-world cyberattacks to identify vulnerabilities and test an organization’s defenses.

**Objective:** Mimic adversaries to uncover system, network, and process weaknesses.

**Techniques Used:**

- Penetration testing
- Social engineering (e.g., phishing)
- Exploitation of vulnerabilities
- Lateral network movement

**Outcome:**

- Detailed report of vulnerabilities and exploited weaknesses

**Example:**

- Conducting a **simulated ransomware attack** to evaluate detection and response capability.

---

### **🔵 Blue Team (Defensive Security)**

**Role:** Detects, prevents, and responds to security incidents.

**Objective:** Protect assets by monitoring, identifying, and mitigating threats.

**Tasks Include:**

- Log analysis and real-time monitoring
- Incident response and containment
- Security awareness training
- Deploying tools (e.g., firewalls, SIEMs)

**Outcome:**

- Strengthened defenses and improved incident-handling

**Example:**

- Investigating and containing a **simulated breach** initiated by the Red Team.

---

### **🟣 Purple Team (Collaborative Security)**

**Role:** Bridges the gap between Red and Blue Teams to optimize security.

**Objective:** Integrate offensive and defensive strategies through collaboration.

**Key Functions:**

- Analyze Red Team findings with Blue Team
- Continuous testing and feedback loop
- Promote cross-team training and coordination

**Outcome:**

- Stronger overall **security posture** and reduced knowledge silos

**Example:**

- Running joint exercises where Red Team shares attack techniques and Blue Team builds real-time defenses.
