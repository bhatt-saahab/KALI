Penetration testing helps identify vulnerabilities by simulating real-world cyberattacks. Based on the level of access and information provided to the tester, methodologies are categorized into three main types:

---

### ⚫ 1. Black Box Testing

- 📝 **Description:**
    
    Tester has **no prior knowledge** of internal systems, architecture, or credentials.
    
- 🎯 **Use Case:**
    
    Simulates an **external attacker** attempting to breach the system.
    
- 🔍 **Focus Areas:**
    - 🌐 Perimeter defenses
    - 🔥 Firewall configurations
    - 🌎 Public-facing applications
    - 📡 DNS & email servers

---

### ⚪ 2. Gray Box Testing

- 📝 **Description:**
    
    Tester has **limited internal knowledge**, such as user credentials or partial architecture details.
    
- 🎯 **Use Case:**
    
    Emulates an **insider threat** or **compromised user account** scenario.
    
- 🔍 **Focus Areas:**
    - 🛡️ Privilege escalation
    - 🔐 Session handling
    - 📋 Access controls
    - 🧠 Business logic flaws

---

### ⚪️ 3. White Box Testing

- 📝 **Description:**
    
    Tester has **complete access** to internal systems, including source code and configurations.
    
- 🎯 **Use Case:**
    
    Ideal for **secure code reviews** and **comprehensive security assessments**.
    
- 🔍 **Focus Areas:**
    - 🧬 Code-level vulnerabilities
    - ⚙️ Misconfigurations
    - ✅ Authentication & authorization
    - 🧑‍💻 Secure development practices
