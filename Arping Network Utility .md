## Overview

- **Definition**: `arping` is a network utility used to discover and probe hosts on a **local network** by sending **Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)** requests at the **data link layer (OSI Layer 2)**.
- Unlike the traditional `ping` command, which operates at the **network layer (OSI Layer 3)** using **ICMP**, `arping` sends ARP requests directly to a host identified by its **IP** or **MAC address** and waits for ARP replies.
- Primarily used to resolve a device's **MAC address** from its **IP address** and check host reachability on a local network.

## Key Features

- Operates at a **lower level** than `ping`, using ARP to map IP addresses to MAC addresses on the local network.
- Displays the **MAC address** of the responding device and the **round-trip time** for ARP request and reply.
- Starts with **broadcast ARP requests**; switches to **unicast** after receiving a reply.
- **Requires root privileges** to run on Linux systems.
- Limited to **local networks** because ARP is not routable beyond the local subnet.
- Supports different implementations:
    - **Linux iputils**: Standard implementation.
    - **Thomas Habets' version**: Adds advanced features like pinging by MAC address.

## Common Options

- **`c <count>`**: Specifies the number of ARP requests to send.
- **`I <interface>`**: Specifies the network interface (e.g., `eth0`).
- **`U`**: Uses unsolicited ARP to update the neighbor's cache.
- **`f`**: Stops sending requests as soon as the first reply is received.
- **`w <seconds>`**: Sets a timeout duration to stop after the specified time.
- **`q`**: Quiet mode, suppresses output.
- **`v`**: Verbose mode for detailed output.
- **`b`**: Sends only MAC broadcasts (no unicast).
- **`D`**: Duplicate address detection mode to identify IP conflicts.
- **`s <MAC>`**: Specifies the source MAC address for outgoing ARP requests (useful for testing or spoofing).

## Common `arping` Commands

1. **Basic Command Without Arguments**:
    - Command: `arping`
    - Description: Displays help or waits for an IP to send ARP requests to. Without an IP or options, it generally does not send requests.
2. **Send ARP Requests to a Host**:
    - Command: `arping 192.168.1.11`
    - Description: Sends ARP requests continuously to the IP address `192.168.1.11` until manually stopped. Used to check if the device responds to ARP.
3. **Send a Single ARP Request**:
    - Command: `arping -c 1 192.168.1.11`
    - Description: Sends exactly one ARP request and stops, useful for quick checks or scripting.
4. **Specify Source MAC Address**:
    - Command: `arping -s 98:28:06:04:19:2c 192.168.1.11`
    - Description: Sends ARP requests with the source MAC address `98:28:06:04:19:2c` to IP `192.168.1.11`, useful for advanced testing or spoofing.
5. **Send One ARP Request with Custom Source MAC to Another IP**:
    - Command: `arping -c 1 -s 98:28:06:04:19:2c 192.168.1.51`
    - Description: Sends a single ARP request with source MAC `98:28:06:04:19:2c` to IP `192.168.1.51`.
6. **Send Two ARP Requests on a Specific Interface with Custom Source MAC**:
    - Command: `arping -c 2 -s 98:28:06:04:19:2c -I eth0 192.168.1.25`
    - Description: Sends two ARP requests from interface `eth0` with source MAC `98:28:06:04:19:2c` to IP `192.168.1.25`.
7. **Send 10 ARP Requests with Specified Interface and Source MAC**:
    - Command: `arping -s 00:00:27:fb:70:00 -c 10 -I eth0 192.168.1.33`
    - Description: Sends 10 ARP requests from interface `eth0` with source MAC `00:00:27:fb:70:00` to IP `192.168.1.33`.

## Example Scripts

### 1. Subnet Scan Using `arping`

- **Purpose**: Scans all IP addresses in the `192.168.1.0/24` subnet to check for active hosts.
- **Script**:
    
    ```bash
    for i in {1..254}; do
        arping -c 1 192.168.1.$i
    done
    
    ```
    
- **Description**:
    - Loops through IPs `192.168.1.1` to `192.168.1.254`.
    - Sends one ARP request to each IP to test if the host is alive.

### 2. Combined `ping` and `arping` Scan Script

- **Purpose**: Scans the `192.168.1.0/24` subnet using both ICMP `ping` and ARP requests to identify online hosts.
- **Script**:
    
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    # Scan the subnet 192.168.1.0/24 with both ICMP ping and ARP requests
    for i in {1..254}
    do
        IP="192.168.1.$i"
        # Ping the IP once with a one-second wait
        ping -c 1 -W 1 $IP >/dev/null
        if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
            echo "Ping: $IP is online"
        fi
        # Send one ARP request and wait one second for reply
        arping -c 1 -w 1 $IP >/dev/null
        if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
            echo "Arping: $IP is online"
        fi
    done
    
    ```
    
- **Description**:
    - Iterates through IPs `192.168.1.1` to `192.168.1.254`.
    - For each IP:
        - Sends one ICMP `ping` with a 1-second timeout, redirecting output to `/dev/null`.
        - If `ping` succeeds (`$? -eq 0`), prints "Ping: $IP is online".
        - Sends one ARP request with a 1-second timeout.
        - If `arping` succeeds (`$? -eq 0`), prints "Arping: $IP is online".

## Additional Notes

- **Use Cases**:
    - Discovering hosts on a local network.
    - Verifying MAC-to-IP mappings.
    - Detecting duplicate IP addresses (`D` option).
    - Testing network connectivity at the data link layer.
- **Limitations**:
    - Only works within the local subnet due to ARP's non-routable nature.
    - Requires root privileges, which may limit usage in restricted environments.
- **Advanced Features** (Thomas Habets' implementation):
    - Supports pinging by MAC address, expanding use cases for network diagnostics.
