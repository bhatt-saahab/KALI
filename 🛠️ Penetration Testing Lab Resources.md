## ✅ **Tips for Effective Learning**

- 🔁 **Practice consistently** — even short daily sessions build skill.
- 📓 **Maintain a hacking journal** — log tools, payloads, and commands.
- 🧩 **Follow the process** — Enumeration → Exploitation → Privilege Escalation.
- 🔍 **Attempt first, read later** — Only check write-ups after genuine effort.
- 🧠 **Focus on understanding**, not just solving.
