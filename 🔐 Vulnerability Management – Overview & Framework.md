## 📌 Definition

**Vulnerability Management** is a continuous process of **identifying**, **evaluating**, **remediating**, **verifying**, and **reporting** security vulnerabilities in systems, applications, and networks.

---

## 🎯 Goal

> Proactively reduce the attack surface and protect organizational assets from potential threats.
>

## 🔄 1. Stages of Vulnerability Management

### 🔍 1.1 Identification

**Purpose:** Discover known and potential vulnerabilities.

**Techniques:**

- ✅ Automated vulnerability scanners
- 🧪 Manual penetration testing
- 🔐 Code reviews and threat modeling

**Common Tools:**

- Nessus
- Qualys
- OpenVAS
- Burp Suite (for web apps)

**Data Sources:**

- 📌 CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)
- 🏛️ NVD (National Vulnerability Database)
- 🛡️ Vendor bulletins
- 🧠 Threat Intelligence platforms

---

### ⚖️ 1.2 Evaluation (Prioritization)

**Purpose:** Assess risk and decide which vulnerabilities to address first.

**Assessment Metrics:**

- 🔢 CVSS Score (Base, Temporal, Environmental)
- 💥 Exploitability and exploit availability
- 💼 Business impact and asset sensitivity
- 🌐 Exposure (external vs internal)

**Prioritization Techniques:**

- 🧮 Risk matrix (likelihood × impact)
- 📰 Threat intelligence (e.g., active exploits in the wild)

---

### 🛠️ 1.3 Remediation

**Purpose:** Eliminate or reduce the impact of vulnerabilities.

**Methods:**

- 🩹 Apply patches/updates
- 🧱 Change configurations
- 🛡️ Add compensating controls (WAF, IDS/IPS)

**Challenges:**

- ⏱️ Downtime and compatibility
- 🔁 Lack of automation
- 🧑‍💼 Business/security trade-offs

---

### ✅ 1.4 Verification

**Purpose:** Ensure remediation was effective.

**Actions:**

- 🔄 Re-run scans
- 📋 Reassess configurations and controls
- 🔬 Perform regression testing

---

### 📝 1.5 Reporting

**Purpose:** Communicate vulnerability status and actions.

**Report Contents:**

- 📈 Vulnerability trends
- 🔍 Risk posture
- 🔧 Completed/pending remediation
- 💡 Recommendations

**Audience:**

- 👥 IT, Security, and Compliance Teams

## 🧩 2. Key Components of Vulnerability Management

### 🧪 2.1 Vulnerability Scanning

- 🔁 Schedule regular scans (weekly/monthly)
- 🌍 Cover internal + external assets
- 🔐 Use authenticated scans for accuracy

### 🩹 2.2 Patch Management

- 🗓️ Maintain a patch calendar
- ⚙️ Automate patch deployment
- 🔁 Include rollback strategies

### 🖥️ 2.3 Asset Management

- 📦 Inventory all hardware, software, cloud assets
- 🏷️ Tag assets by criticality
- 🔍 Use discovery tools to detect rogue systems

### ⚠️ 2.4 Risk Management

- 🧩 Integrate with enterprise risk frameworks
- ✅ Define risk acceptance criteria
- 🎯 Align with overall business risk appetite

---

## ⚠️ 3. Challenges in Vulnerability Management

- 📊 **High Volume**: Overwhelming number of findings
- ⏳ **Zero-Day Exploits**: No fixes available
- ❌ **False Positives**: Waste time/resources
- ⚔️ **Prioritization Conflicts**: Security vs business needs
- 🧑‍💻 **Resource Constraints**: Limited team/tools

---

## 🛠️ 4. Popular Tools

### 💼 Commercial Tools

- **Qualys VMDR** – Cloud-based vulnerability management
- **Tenable.io / Nessus** – Industry standard scanner
- **Rapid7 InsightVM** – Real-time visibility and prioritization

### 💻 Open Source Tools

### 🔗 Integrated Platforms

- **SIEMs** – Splunk, IBM QRadar
- **EDR Tools** – CrowdStrike, SentinelOne

---

## 🧠 5. Best Practices

- ✔️ Run scheduled + ad-hoc scans
- ⚙️ Automate triage and ticketing (Jira, ServiceNow)
- 🛡️ Publish a Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP)
- 💻 Embed secure coding in SDLC
- 🔍 Monitor threat intelligence feeds
- 📈 Track key metrics like **MTTR (Mean Time to Remediate)**

---

## 🧾 Summary

**Vulnerability Management** is a core cybersecurity function requiring close collaboration between **IT**, **security**, and **business units**.

✅ If done right, it:

- 📉 Reduces risk exposure
- 🛡️ Ensures regulatory compliance
- 🧠 Strengthens overall cyber resilience
