# 🎯 **Defense-in-Depth (DiD)**

> Strategy: Multiple layers of defense to protect data, systems, and networks. If one fails, others continue to provide protection.

## 🧱 **Key Principles of Defense-in-Depth**

### 🛡️ **1. Layered Security**

Apply controls at multiple levels (hardware, software, network, users) to increase difficulty for attackers.

### 🔁 **2. Redundancy**

Overlapping defenses ensure protection even if one control fails.

### 🧩 **3. Segmentation**

Divide networks into zones to isolate and contain breaches.

### 🕵️ **4. Detection & Response**

Use tools and processes to quickly identify, respond to, and recover from incidents.

### 🔐 **5. Least Privilege**

Limit access to only what is necessary for users or systems.

## 🧩 **Components of Defense-in-Depth**

### 🏢 **1. Physical Security**

Protect infrastructure from unauthorized physical access or environmental threats.

**Examples:**

- 🧍 Security guards & CCTV
- 🔐 Biometric access
- 🧯 Fire suppression systems

---

### 🌐 **2. Network Security**

Protects data in transit & restricts network access.

**Examples:**

- 🔥 Firewalls (e.g., pfSense, Cisco ASA)
- 👀 IDS/IPS (e.g., Snort, Suricata)
- 🔐 VPNs for remote access
- 🧱 VLANs & subnetting
- 🚪 Network Access Control (NAC)

---

### 💻 **3. Endpoint Security**

Secures devices like servers, laptops, etc.

**Examples:**

- 🛡️ Antivirus & EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response)
- 🧰 Patch management
- 🧽 Hardening systems

---

### 📲 **4. Application Security**

Protects apps from threats and vulnerabilities.

**Examples:**

- 🧑‍💻 Secure coding (e.g., OWASP Top 10)
- 🔰 WAF (Web Application Firewall)
- ✅ Input validation, output encoding
- 🔎 Code reviews & auto scanners
- 🎯 Pen testing

---

### 🧾 **5. Data Security**

Ensures **CIA** – Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability.

**Examples:**

- 🔒 Encryption at rest (AES-256), in transit (TLS)
- 🧑‍⚖️ Access controls & data classification
- 🚫 DLP (Data Loss Prevention)
- 💾 Backups & DRP (Disaster Recovery Plan)

---

### 🧑‍💼 **6. Identity and Access Management (IAM)**

Controls user identities and permissions.

**Examples:**

- 🧩 MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)
- 🧑‍🏫 RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
- 🌐 SSO (Single Sign-On)

## 🌍 **Scenario: Defense-in-Depth for a Web Application**

| 🔒 **Layer** | ⚙️ **Implementation Details** |
| --- | --- |
| 🏢 Physical | Biometric access, CCTV, secured racks |
| 🌐 Network | Firewall, IDS/IPS, VPN |
| 💻 Endpoint | Antivirus, EDR on servers & admin systems |
| 🧑‍💻 Application | WAF, secure coding, input validation |
| 📁 Data | AES-256 encryption, secure backups |
| 👥 IAM | MFA, RBAC, regular access reviews |
| 🧠 Awareness | Staff training on phishing, social engineering |
| 🧭 Monitoring | SIEM tools with real-time alerting |
| 🔁 Recovery | Daily backups, DRP testing, HA infrastructure |

---

### ✅ **Summary**

Defense-in-Depth ensures **resilience, layered protection, and quick recovery** by combining multiple safeguards. It reduces risk and limits damage in the event of a breach.
