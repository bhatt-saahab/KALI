## Overview

A **vulnerability assessment** is a systematic process to identify, analyze, and prioritize risks and vulnerabilities within IT ecosystems, including:

- Computer networks
- Systems
- Hardware
- Applications
- Infrastructure components

### Primary Goal

- Provide security teams and stakeholders with actionable insights to mitigate risks effectively.
- Uncover weaknesses to proactively address potential threats before exploitation.

### Process

- Evaluate critical infrastructures for exposure to attacks.
- Measure the effectiveness of security controls.
- Validate security measures post-implementation.

## Categories of Vulnerabilities

### 1. Service Vulnerabilities

Weaknesses in services running on systems, such as:

- **Web**: HTTP servers
- **FTP**: File Transfer Protocol servers
- **DNS**: Domain Name System servers
- **NFS**: Network File System
- **SMB**: Server Message Block

### 2. Protocol Vulnerabilities

Issues in communication protocols, including:

- **HTTP/HTTPS**: Web protocols
- **TCP/UDP**: Transport layer protocols
- **SSL/TLS**: Secure communication protocols

### 3. Host OS Vulnerabilities

Vulnerabilities in operating systems, such as:

- **Windows**
- **Linux**
- **macOS**
- **Unix variants**

### 4. Client-Side Vulnerabilities

Weaknesses in client-facing software, including:

- **Web Browsers**
- **Email Clients**
- **Office/Desktop Applications**
- **Mobile Apps**

### 5. Network Device Vulnerabilities

Vulnerabilities in network hardware, such as:

- **Hubs**
- **Switches**
- **Routers**
- **Firewalls**
- **Wireless Access Points**

### 6. Intermediate System Vulnerabilities

Issues in intermediary devices, including:

- **Proxy Servers**
- **Load Balancers**
- **IDS/IPS Systems**: Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems
- **VPN Gateways**

## Vulnerability Research

### Definition

Vulnerability research involves systematically analyzing products, protocols, or algorithms to discover, understand, and document security flaws.

### Key Techniques

1. **Reverse Engineering**: Analyzing software or hardware to understand its functionality and identify vulnerabilities.
2. **Code Auditing**: Manual or automated review of source code to find security issues.
3. **Static Analysis**: Examining code without executing it.
4. **Dynamic Analysis**: Testing software during execution to identify runtime vulnerabilities.
5. **Fuzz Testing**: Inputting invalid or unexpected data to uncover software weaknesses.
6. **Debugging and Exploit Development**: Identifying and creating exploits for discovered vulnerabilities.

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)

### Overview

- **CVE** is a publicly available reference for common security vulnerabilities and exposures.
- Enables organizations to track, share, and remediate known threats consistently.

### Notable CVE Resources

- **CVE Database (MITRE)**: Centralized database for CVE entries.
    
    ```
    https://cve.mitre.org/
    
    ```
    
- **NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD)**: Provides detailed vulnerability information and CVSS scores.
    
    ```
    https://nvd.nist.gov/
    
    ```

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

### Overview

- **CVSS** is a standardized framework to assess and score IT vulnerabilities based on:
    - **Exploitability**: Ease of exploiting the vulnerability.
    - **Impact**: Potential damage caused by exploitation.
    - **Remediation Complexity**: Difficulty of fixing the vulnerability.
- Helps prioritize remediation by assigning severity levels: **Low**, **Medium**, **High**, **Critical**.

### CVSS Calculators

- **CVSS v2 Calculator (NVD)**:
