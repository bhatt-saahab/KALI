## 📁 1. Common Website Files & Their Purpose

| 🔹 File Name | 📌 Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `readme.html` | HTML page with project info, version, authors — like a digital brochure. |
| `readme.txt` | Text-based instructions about website/software — simple and accessible. |
| `readme.md` | Markdown file often seen in GitHub projects — formatted README. |
| `license.txt` | Legal terms of use, license agreements, author rights. |
| `feed.xml` / `rss.xml` | Syndication feed for blogs/news — used by feed readers. |

🔐 **Security Risk**

- **Info Disclosure:** Version, server info helps hackers find weaknesses.
- **Fingerprinting:** Used to profile technologies.
- **Example:** If `readme.html` shows WordPress 5.4, attacker may search for known exploits in that version.

## 🔐 Security Implications

| ⚠️ Risk Type | 📌 Description |
| --- | --- |
| 🧾 Information Disclosure | Revealing versions or frameworks can give attackers entry points. |
| 🧠 Technology Fingerprinting | Makes it easy to identify CMS (like WordPress), DBs, or frameworks used. |
| 🤖 Automation Tools | Scanners like **WhatWeb** and **BuiltWith** automate these detections. |

## 👨‍💻 Real-World Example

A hacker scans a company blog and finds `readme.txt` exposing **Drupal 7.3** → this version is outdated → attacker searches for CVEs → potential exploit path.
